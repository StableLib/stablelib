/**
 * NewHope provides post-quantum Ring-LWE-based key exchange between two peers.
 *
 * One peer generates an "offer message"" by calling offer(), and sends it to
 * the other peer. The other peer accepts the offer and generates "accept
 * message" by calling accept() with the received offer message. It then send
 * the result to the first peer, which calls finish(). After completing these
 * steps, both peers call getSharedKey() to get the established shared key.
 *
 * This is a reference version, which uses SHAKE-128 and SHA-3-256. You can
 * create a custom version by requiring "lib/custom" and extending
 * CustomNewHope class.
 *
 * Reference:
 *
 * Erdem Alkim, Léo Ducas, Thomas Pöppelmann, and Peter Schwabe: Post-quantum
 * key exchange – a new hope.
